INTRODUCTION TO THE UNIX/Linux OPERATING SYSTEM
Lab 2: SIMPLE FILE COMMANDS 


Show what command(s) you used to do each action below.

You can turn this lab in on paper or by mail or by attaching it to the "assignments" tab (in "Homework for week 2"). What you need to do is say what commands you used to find the answer to each question. You do NOT have to turn in the history or script for this lab. There is an on-line copy of this lab in my direcory: 
~isaacs/class/unix.part1/lab2 -- the easiest thing to do might be to either edit a copy of that, or print it out and write the answers.


1. Create a file "text1".
touch text1

2. Fill this file in with text,
with at least a couple of lines of text.
vim text1

3. Close the file. 
:wq

4. Browse the file. Look at the beginning of the file; look at the end. 
head text1 
tail text1

5. Copy the file "text1" to a new file.
cp text1 newtext1

6. Change the name of the old file.
mv text1 changedtext1

7. How do you know it's there (what commands could you use to find out?)
ls

8. What command(s) will show its permissions?
ls -l

9. What command(s) will show how big it is?
ls -lh

10. What command(s) will show how many lines are in it?
wc changedtext1

11. Change the permissions on the file so that everyone can read it, and
no one (not even the owner) can write it.
chmod 444 changedtext1 

12. Make a new file using the "echo" command.
echo > newfile

13.  Make the file you just made executable (but not writable) by everybody.
chmod 755 newfile 

14. Try to change the owner to someone else: for instance, make "isaacs" 
the owner. (It should fail -- you can only change owner if you
are the superuser.)
chown isaacs newfile 

Change the permissions of the file. 
chmod 777 newfile 

Delete the file (use "rm" command.)
rm newfile
