1) What facts of reality give rise for the need of Loops ?
Chunks of code will need to be run multiple times, all the time.
2) What are the three parts governing a for loop ?
The three parts governing a for loop are a variable, a condition, and a variable change.
3) What is an Infinite Loop ?
An infinite loop is a loop that goes on forever, usually as a result of incorrectly declaring the condition.
4) Write a Condition that would result in an infinite loop.
for (int i = 1; i > 0; i++) {
    cout << "This is an infinite loop.\n";
}
5) What type of Sequence is a loop ?
A loop is a repeating sequence.
6) What does the flow chart for a for loop look like ?

7) What is the differences between a pretest and post-test loop ?
A pretest loop performs the condition test before the code is run, while the post-test loop performs the condition test after the code is run.
8) What is a nested for loop ? Give an example.
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    cout << "First layer";
    for (int j = 1; j <= 10; j ++) {
        cout << "Second layer";
    }
}
9) What does the setw() function do ? Did you use it in your code ?
The setw() function lets you get the width of the output.  I used it in my code.
10) Which is better ?
	a. Write a block of code 10 times
	b. Write a block of code 1 time and copy and paste 9 more times
	c. Write a block of code 1 time and place it in a loop structure that repeats it 10 times
C is better.
11) Research online, the three conditions in the for loop. Which do you need, which can you do without ?
You do not need any of the conditions for the for loop to be valid.  The only thing you need is the semicolons.
12) Why do lazy programmers use loops ?
They use loops so that they don't have to write or copy-paste code multiple times.
13) What does 'contiguous' mean ?
Contiguous means in sequence.
14) How are a simple sequence and a loop different ?
A simple sequence is only run once, while a loop is run multiple times.
15) Why do you like or dislike loops ?
I like loops because they help shorten your code and the time it takes to write it.
