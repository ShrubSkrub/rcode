1) Can a switch statement do the same thing as an if else statement? if so, give an example.
A switch statement can (for the most part) do the same thing as an if else statement.  For example:
if (i == 2) {
    cout << "Two";
} else if (i == 3) {
    cout << "Three";
} else {
    cout << "Not two or three";
}

switch (i) {
    case 2:
        cout << "Two";
        break;
    case 3:
        cout << "Three";
        break;
    default:
        cout << "Not two or three";
}
These two snippets of code do the same thing, even though one is an if and the other a switch.
2) What data types can you use in a switch statement ?
You can use int or char in a switch statement.
3) What does the break statement do ?
The break statement ends the switch statement prematurely.
4) What does "Fall Through" mean ?
Fall through means that the first true condition/case causes the rest of the switch's code to be run.
5) What does the default word do in a switch statement ?
The default case is what is run if the input does not match any case in the statement.
6) What are the uses for the switch statement ?
The uses for a switch statement include creating menus or an alternative to simple if statements.
7) Why does the switch start in the OFF state ?
The switch starts in the off state because otherwise the code would always be executed, making the use of a switch statement unnecessary.
8) Is it necessary to have switch statement, or can you do basically the same with if, and if else statements ?
It is not necessary.  You can basically do the same with if and if else statements.
9) Which are the only data types that can be used with the switch conditions/cases ?
You can only use int or char in a switch statement.
10) Find a good www.youtube.com video that explains the switch statement in C++, write a summary.

11) What does the default option do in a switch statement ?
The default option is what is run if the input does not match any case in the statement.
12) Can you have two or more conditions for a case in a switch ? ( Internet research )
No, you cannot have two or more conditions for a case in a switch.
13) Can you turn the switch statement OFF, after it is turned ON ? ( Internet research )
You cannot explicitly turn a switch statement off, but the closest thing to turning a switch statement off again would be a break statement.
14) Can you have fall through with cascading if statements ?
You cannot have a fall through with cascading if statements.
15) What do you prefer, the if or switch statement ? Why...
I prefer the switch statement for multiple simple conditions, as it is more condensed for that, but I prefer the if statement for more complex conditions that need to be tested, as a switch statement cannot provide that.
