10 Questions

a. What is a logical short circuit? for the AND and OR
A short circuit for the AND would be the first false statement the program encounters.  For the OR, the short circuit would be the first true statement instead.
b. How should you organize the expressions in a certain order to take advantage of the short circuit of a complex condition?
You should put the most important variable or most likely to short-circuit variable first, as then the program doesn't have to spend time evaluating the rest of the code, thereby increasing the speed of your program.
c. What does the ( a = a ) used as a condition do? Code it up and try it. Declare and assign a: int a = 42;
I wrote a small program, as you suggested, to try it:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    if (int a = 42) {
        cout << "True";
    } else {
        cout << "False";
    }
    return 0;
}
This printed True.  I believe this is because the operation did not fail, which returns 1, which means True.
d. Give an example of a multiple AND condition you use in your ever day life.
An example of a multiple AND condition I use in my everyday life is:
if (haveWork && haveTime && notHungry) { startWork(); }
e. Give an example of a multiple OR condition you use in your ever day life.
An example of a multiple OR condition I use in my everyday life is:
if (haveTime || (! haveWork) || (! feelgood)) { relax(); }
f. What is the purpose of a Truth Table?
The purpose of a truth table is to show all the possible results of a logical expression.
g. Which of the 3 code examples in this lecture compile correctly or do they have syntax errors?
Code examples 1 and 2 compile correctly and have no syntax errors.  Code example 3 is missing the brackets for the if statement, but the code still compiles and functions.
h. What is the difference between a simple and complex condition?
A simple condition uses only one relationship/comparison, while a complex condition uses more than one.
i. What is the best type of criteria?
The best type of criteria is one that you can measure and take action on.
j. What happens if you use the condition (TRUE) in an if statement, is it good to do so?
If you used the condition TRUE in an if statement, the code would always be run, thereby making the if useless.  Generally speaking, this is not good to do so, but could be useful when debugging to make sure the code inside the if is actually working.
