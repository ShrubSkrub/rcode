1) What is an array ?
An array is a way to declare multiple variables at once.
2) What are the restrictions on the datatype for each element of an array ?
A char is 1 byte, an int is 4 bytes, a float is 4 bytes, and a double is 8 bytes.
3) Why use an array ?
You should use an array because it saves time and makes writing code easier.
4) What is the 'Offset problem' with arrays ?
The offset problem is that arrays start at 0, so if you declare an array with a size of 10, the index is 0-9.
5) What is short list initialization? Give an example
Short list initialization is assigning all the variables in an array a single value.  Example:
int array[20] = {0};
6) What is long list initialization? Give an example
Long list initialization is individually assigning each of the elements in an array a value.  Example:
int shortArray[4] = {54, 89, 67, 101};
7) What are Nested for loops ?
Nested for loops are for loops that contain another for loop inside it's itself.
8) What are multidimensional arrays ?
Multidimensional arrays are arrays that have more than 1 range of value; a two dimensional array would be a table.
9) Why are the array elements contiguous ?
Array elements are contiguous because it makes it easier to the computer to retrieve the data.
10) Do you like arrays ?
I like array because they are very useful.
